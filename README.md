# Macro Programming

After being a machinist for over 16 years now, I have encountered quite a few fun scenarios where macro programming and/or probing has saved the day, or made a job silly easy. This is a collection of things I have made over the years and I hope they help someone else in a tight spot.

I believe in sharing knowledge, so I want to post what I have made for anyone to use. Also, if you have something to contriubte, why not make a pull request? Maybe we can start to build a nice little library.
